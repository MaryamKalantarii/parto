## Overview

**AUREL — Objects of Light.** is a fictional luxury jewelry brand and a modern e-commerce web experience designed around the relationship between precious materials, sculptural forms, light, and digital storytelling.

Rather than following the conventions of a traditional online jewelry store, AUREL approaches commerce as an editorial experience. Cinematic imagery, restrained typography, immersive compositions, and carefully orchestrated motion create a digital environment inspired by contemporary luxury, architectural minimalism, and high-fashion art direction.

The project combines a premium visual identity with a multi-page storefront, product discovery, shopping flows, and account-related interfaces.

## Design Philosophy

AUREL is built around a simple principle:

> Objects of light. Designed to be experienced.

The visual direction emphasizes:

- **Quiet luxury** — refined typography, restrained colors, and intentional negative space.
- **Sculptural minimalism** — jewelry presented as an object of design rather than a conventional product listing.
- **Cinematic art direction** — dark architectural environments, atmospheric lighting, and material-focused imagery.
- **Motion with purpose** — animation and transitions designed to support storytelling and navigation.
- **Editorial composition** — oversized typography, asymmetric layouts, and a strong visual hierarchy.
- **Digital craftsmanship** — attention to detail across page layouts, interactions, responsive behavior, and reusable components.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js — a version compatible with the project's Next.js requirements
- npm
- Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mhidusti/AUREL.git
cd AUREL
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

This repository contains both `package.json` and a pnpm lockfile. For a reproducible installation, use the package manager and lockfile maintained by the project.

Using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### 4. Create a Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### 5. Run the Production Server Locally

```bash
npm run start
```

Build the application before running the production server.

## Deployment

AUREL is deployed on Render as a Next.js web service.

**Live URL:** https://aurel-z71t.onrender.com

Typical service configuration:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime | Node.js |
| Build command | `npm install && npm run build` |
| Start command | `npm run start` |
| Application port | Provided by the hosting environment |

For production deployments, keep dependency versions and lockfiles synchronized. Use a supported, security-patched Next.js release and review dependency advisories before updating the deployment.

## Responsive Design

The interface is designed with multiple screen sizes in mind, including:

- Desktop and large-screen editorial layouts
- Tablet-friendly content arrangements
- Mobile navigation and content flow
- Responsive typography and spacing
- Adaptable imagery and product presentations

Responsive behavior should be validated on actual devices and browsers as the interface evolves.

## Performance & Code Quality

The project uses Next.js production builds and TypeScript checks to validate the application before deployment.

Recommended ongoing improvements include:

- Optimize large images and use responsive image delivery.
- Review accessibility, keyboard navigation, and color contrast.
- Reduce unnecessary client-side JavaScript.
- Test navigation, forms, and shopping flows end to end.
- Keep dependencies updated and resolve security advisories.
- Test production behavior after every deployment.

## Roadmap

Potential future improvements include:

- [ ] Complete accessibility and keyboard-navigation audits
- [ ] Optimize image loading and delivery
- [ ] Refine mobile-specific motion and interactions
- [ ] Integrate persistent cart and wishlist storage
- [ ] Connect authentication to a secure backend
- [ ] Integrate a payment provider and order processing
- [ ] Add product search, filtering, and sorting
- [ ] Expand automated testing and error handling
- [ ] Improve SEO metadata and structured product data
